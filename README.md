DESCRIPTION


NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge 
about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a 
patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.
Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). 
Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, 
age, and more.


Introduction:


This report presents the steps followed to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build a 
classification model on a given dataset. The dataset consists of several variables, including a target 
variable, and the goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify the target variable. The 
report provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis and modeling process, including data 
preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and interpretation of the results.
